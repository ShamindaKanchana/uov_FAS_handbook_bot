The duration of a semester is sixteen weeks, with a one week mid -- -- semester vacation nearly halfway through the semester. The Bachelors degree programmes encompass six semesters (three consecutive academic years), whereas the Honours degree programmes consist of eight semesters (four consecutive academic years). Each course unit carries a credit value that defines contact hours for that course unit. The student should satisfy the credit requirement of a minimum of 90 credits of core course units at the end of the sixth semester for the award of Bachelors Degree and a minimum of 120 credits of core course units at the end of the eighth semester for the award of Honours Degree.",
