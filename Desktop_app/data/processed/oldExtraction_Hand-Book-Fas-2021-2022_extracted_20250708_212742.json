The Faculty of Technological Studies was established in February 2020 (No. 2160/43 order under section 27(1), Universities Act No. 16 of 1978) by the Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation of Sri Lanka. The Vavuniya Campus of the University of Jaffna was then elevated to a separate state university and established as the ”University of Vavuniya, Sri Lanka” by an extraordinary gazette issued on June 8, 2021. Accordingly, the University of Vavuniya became the 17th state University in Sri Lanka with effective from 1st August 2021. The permanent site of the University of Vavuniya is about ten kilometres away from Vavuniya in the Vavuniya-Mannar road at Sopalapuliyankulam, Pampaimadu. One hundred and sixty acres of land was allocated and reserved for the construction of academic, administrative, and residential buildings. Vavuniya, in the southern part of the Northern Province, is a melting pot of cultures from the Vanni region and the north-central region of Sri Lanka. A culture that has been influenced and shaped by the Vanniyas (of whom the King Pandaravanniyan is a prominent example). This district has ties even with the Paduvankarai regions that extend to the Southernmost part of the Northern and Eastern provinces an indication of how the Vanniya people have contributed to the rich culture of the Tamil speaking societies of Sri Lanka. Vavuniya is renowned for its mild climate, which provides a pleasant change from the usual arid conditions of the coastal regions of the Northern and Eastern provinces. As such, it provides an ideal setting for the Faculty of Applied Science, with a pleasant environment to indulge in educational and extra-curricular activities. Further, as per present conditions, Vavuniya provides a strategic location that acts as a transit point for the movement of people as well as various financial and industrial activities/processes. Thus, Vavuniya is expected to grow into a prominent financial and cultural hub in Sri Lanka. The Faculty of Applied Science as an academic organization has a flexible, friendly, and conducive internal environment that allows for effective teaching, learning, and research. This is due to the fact that the faculty has a unique signatured culture where the student and staff interactions are high-level and one-to-one attention is administered to the students by the teachers. Further, the faculty has very strong ties with the community of Vavuniya and it is seen as a key and prominent player in the advisory capacities of all development endeavours taking place in the locality. The Faculty of Applied Science of the University of Vavuniya",

Level 1 Semester I has been designed to incorporate the fundamentals of Environmental Science in different disciplines of Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology in addition to Basic Mathematics and Fundamentals of Information Technology. From Level 1 Semester II to Level 4 Semester II, the curriculum deals with the detailed study of environmental science. The curriculum in Level 4 focuses on a research project and industrial training for a period of two months. The chosen research topics of regional and national interest, mainly related to natural resourcesandenvironmentalissueswouldhelptodeveloptheirresearchskillsandpromotetheir in-depth knowledge in the chosen research area. Further, in order to enable students to gain knowledge on the wide range of environmental issues such as the resource exploitation, environmental disasters, environmental pollution, solid and hazardous waste disposal, wastewater discharge, deforestation, wildlife management, and unplanned urbanization, students are requested to prepare field report by visiting to the fields as a part of the course units. These field based assignments and the course unit titled as ‘Seminar’ facilitate Student Centered Learning (SCL) which cater the skills such as communication, teamwork, leadership, creativity, problem solving, managerial and entrepreneurial, data analysis, IT applications for environmental management, social networking, adaptability, and flexibility to the undergraduates.

Evaluation of Theory Course: The final marks of a theory examination is evaluated by adding the ICA and ESE with appropriate ratio assigned to both ICA and ESE. Hence the final mark M1 for the theory course is defined as follows: M1 = T ×70%+A1 ×30% where T is the mark obtained in the end-semester theory examination, and A1 is the average mark of the In-course Assessments. Evaluation of Practical Course: The final mark of a practical examination is evaluated by giving 40% for In-course Assessment and 60% for the End-semester Examination. The final mark M2 for the practical course is defined as follows: M2 = P ×60% +A2 ×40% whereP isthemarksobtainedintheend-semesterpracticalexaminationandA2istheaverage of the In-course Assessments. Evaluation of Theory Course Unit with Practical Component: The final mark is evaluated using the individual marks obtained in the theory and practical examination. Students obtaining less than 40% marks in either theory or practical will obtain ‘E’ grade, even if the average is greater than 40%. The final mark M for the course unit with theory and practical components is evaluated as follows: Ct ×M1 +Cp ×M2 M = Ct +Cp where Ct and Cp are the credit value of the theory part and practical part of a course respectively. Evaluation of Industrial Training The final marks evaluation of industrial training is assessed by the members of the evaluation panel appointed by the Head of the Department with the approval of the Faculty Board and shall contain a senior staff from the institution where the student obtains the training and two senior staff at the Department of Bio-science. The evaluation is based on the following criteria.",

The Bachelors degree programmes encompass six semesters (three consecutive academic years), whereas the Honours degree programmes consist of eight semesters (four consecutive academic years). Each course unit carries a credit value that defines contact hours for that course unit. The student should satisfy the credit requirement of a minimum of 90 credits of core course units at the end of the sixth semester for the award of Bachelors Degree and a minimum of 120 credits of core course units at the end of the eighth semester for the award of Honours Degree. In addition, the students are requested to complete 16 credits in auxiliary course units. Initially, students would be admitted to a Bachelors degree programme (6 semesters), and a selected number of students will be admitted to follow the Honours degree (8 semesters) based on their performance.",
