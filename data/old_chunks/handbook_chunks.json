As such, each academic year is considered as level 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Each level of study is divided into two semesters, semester 1 and semester 2. The duration of a semester is sixteen weeks, with a one week mid-semester vacation nearly halfway through the semester. The Bachelors degree programmes encompass six semesters (three consecutive academic years), whereas the Honours degree programmes consist of eight semesters (four consecutive academic years). Each course unit carries a credit value that defines contact hours for that course unit.

They try to learn the systems objectives, organization, administrative process, progress of ongoing projects, problems faced by, practical issues if any, etc. in the industry. They record all the work done and knowledge gained by maintaining a Daily Diary. The academic supervisor will provide ongoing support to the student.
